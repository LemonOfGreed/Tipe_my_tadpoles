# Tipe_my_tadpoles
This project is made for my internship

Hello and welcome to my first ever web app.

TLDR: I faced a lot of challenges in making this project, because I have never done something like this before, but I overcame them and made it anyways. Itâ€™s basic and unpolished but I am still proud of my baby.

First, as I said above, I have never made anything close to a web app or animation, so since I had no experience, I thought I might as well do it in TypeScript. My first challenge was to learn TypeScriptâ€™s basics, I done it by doing a lot of Googling and watching lots and lots of YouTube videos. After three days of learning I stumbled upon a video explaining how to make games using TypeScript. With this video I made my first prototype where I made bunch of circles that would have random starting velocities and would get other random velocities then they would reach the canvas border. It looked great but then I stared implementing collisions with the other circles, it looked terrible. After this disaster, I understood that I will need to redo my code entirely. I did some research again and found out that simulating gravity would do the trick, because I would need to add a minus to the gravitational formula to simulate repulsion. After finding this out I just needed to find a video explaining it. After finding it I made a prototype that would simulate gravity at the center of the canvas. Then I made it to simulate repulsion, then I added repulsion to the canvas borders and other circles. It looked good at first, but because of lack of friction (or other things that I am not sure about) my circles would speed up so much that they would jump out of canvas. It was amusing to watch, but it didnâ€™t really simulate social distancing (maybe at extreme measures it did). So, I added a little bit of code that would limit the peak velocity and it worked great. The last thing on my list was the mouse repulsion I didnâ€™t had any problems with it, I just need to add mouse coordinates. After this my code was sort of finished, but then I wanted to lower the amount of calculation my program made. The prime contender for this were repulsion calculations, because two distant circles repellant force was close to 0 so why do calculations on it. I made a specific effect radius where they would continue making calculations, it made a slight difference in app's speed. While debugging I made that the circles would turn red when they are in the mouse effect radius, it looked nice, so I left it in. The last thing I made was simple GUI for changing the specific values so it would be easier to play around with the simulation.

I had put a lot of time in it, like more then 4 hours a day, and I worked for 8 days or so, but ill be honest, more than 80%  of that time was spent on watching YouTube, googling and looking through the window and enjoying the spring view. I am sure that if I would have a mentor or more experience with JavaScript or TypeScript, I would have made it much faster.

In the end, I had a blast while I was making this web app. I know that it could look better, but I am damn proud of it ðŸ˜Š.
